# CharMad
Code written by Charlotte Madill for a University project. 

The aim is to make this run 10 times..

(all the variables are defined and the code works) but what i now have to do is make the whole thing happen 10 times (i have a defined variable called no_of_randwalks which equals 10 but the code has to be general so need to use the variable called no_of_randwalks). So currently this code produces two textfiles, one with loads of lines with a time in column 1 and then the values of each population and the other file prints the last line of the time and populations before the loop breaks. What i need is after the loop breaks for it to go back to the begining and do it all over again using the initial populations and writing the new data under the old stuff but in the same text file ideally... the values will be different because there are random numbers generated within the code (r1 and r2). So i think i need a for loop e.g. 'for i in range(0, no_of_randwallks) but then i dont know how to like put the i into the code and it seems really basic but i have no idea how to do it. i also need to like reset the populations to the initial ones somehow .... sorry if this is really confusing !!!
